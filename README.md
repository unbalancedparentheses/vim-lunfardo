# Vim Lunfardo

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unbalancedparentheses/lunfardo/master/images/buenosaires.jpg)

In the mid XIX century, Buenos Aires was pullulating with immigrants, mainly Spanish and Italian. Many of them were impoverished and blended in with 
the already-poor locals: the descendents of aborigins and african slaves.

From the amalgam of the newcomers' languages with Argentina's 'castilian', emerged ther slang known as Lunfardo.

It was created by criminals, mainly to avoid being understood by prison guards.

It was disseminated thanks to 'tango' lyrics, a music which was born as suburban, marginal and was swiftly forbidden by the Church and higher classes. Tango was played and danced in ports, brothels, bars and prisons.

Nowadays, Lunfardo has blended into the castilian language and is part of its idiosincrasy.

# Features

## Plugins

### jumplist
* `<C-o>` jump back to the previous (older) location
* `<C-i>` jump forward to the next (newer) location

###[vim-sleuth](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth)
This plugin automatically adjusts 'shiftwidth' and 'expandtab' heuristically based on the current file, or, in the case the current file is new, blank, or otherwise insufficient, by looking at other files of the same type in the current and parent directories.

### indent and unindent

* <Tab> in visual mode indent select lines
* <S-Tab> in visual mode unindent select lines

### [CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)

Fuzzy file, buffer, mru and tag finder

* `<Space-p>` invokes CtrlP
* `<F5>` to purge the cache for the current directory to get new files, remove deleted files and apply new ignore options
* `<C-f>` and `<C-b>` to cycle between modes
* `<C-d>` to switch to filename only search instead of full path
* `<C-r>` to switch to regexp mode
* `<C-j>`, `<C-k>` or the arrow keys to navigate the result list
* `<C-t>` or `<C-v>`, `<C-x>` to open the selected entry in a new tab or in a new split
* `<C-n>`, `<C-p>` to select the next/previous string in the prompt's history
* `<C-y>` to create a new file and its parent directories
* `<c-z>` to mark/unmark multiple files and <c-o> to open them

### Yank ring

* `<Space-y>` Yank menu

### Command line history

* `<Space-c>` Command history

### [dwm](https://github.com/spolu/dwm.vim)

Tiled Window Management for Vim:

* `<C-n>` Creates a new window and place it in the master pane [M] & stacks all previous windows in the stacked pane [S]
* `<C-c>` Close the current window if no unsaved changes
* `<C-j>` Jumps to next window (clockwise)
* `<C-k>` Jumps to previous window (anti-clockwise)
* `<C-Space>` Focus the current window, that is, place it in the master pane [M] & stacks all other windows in the stacked pane [S]

### [BufferGator](https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/vim-buffergator)

Buffergator is a plugin for listing, navigating between, and selecting buffers to edit. Upon invocation (using the command, :BuffergatorOpen or BuffergatorToggle, or the provided key mapping, <Leader>b), a catalog of listed buffers are displayed in a separate new window split (vertical or horizontal, based on user options; default = vertical). From this "buffer catalog", a buffer can be selected and opened in an existing window, a new window split (vertical or horizontal), or a new tab page.

Selected buffers can be "previewed", i.e. opened in a window or tab page, but with focus remaining in the buffer catalog. Even better, you can "walk" up and down the list of buffers shown in the catalog by using <C-N> (or <SPACE>) / <C-P> (or <C-SPACE>). These keys select the next/previous buffer in succession, respectively, opening it for preview without leaving the buffer catalog viewer.

### [ferret](https://github.com/wincent/ferret)
Ferret provides an :Ack command for searching across multiple files using The Silver Searcher, Ack, or Grep. Support for passing options through to the underlying search command exists, along with the ability to use full regular expression syntax without doing special escaping.

* `<leader>a` Search prompt
* `<leader>s` Search for the word currently under the cursor
